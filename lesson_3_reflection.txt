When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository helps to show the world the file and we can use them in other computers other than personal in necessary.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Manual pulling give idea about the changes made to the program.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are used to copy the contents of any others code to your Github profile.
  Clones are used to save the code to my computer.
  Branches are used when we want to work a little different or add a special feature to the existing one.
